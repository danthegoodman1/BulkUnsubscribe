# BulkUnsubscribe Privacy Policy

Our detailed privacy policy can be found below, but in simple terms, we store:

1. Your email address
2. The message ID of each email unsubscribed from (totally random ID, not associative)
3. Emails addresses or links needed from unsubscribing for up to 7 days (not associated with your email)
4. Logs for unparseable email headers (only if email is unsubscribe-able, may include senders and subjects, never email content) for up to 14-30 days depending on log level

**What we do not store, ever, or even log**:

1. Email content (we can't even see that)
2. Subject lines or senders (except for when it breaks parsing and we need to know why to fix it, then it's only if email is unsubscribe-able)

All information you see for listing emails is generated on-demand when you load the page, and is not logged.

BulkUnsubscribe is fully open source, you can inspect the code [on Github](https://github.com/danthegoodman1/BulkUnsubscribe/)

You can request info deletion by sending an email to `deleteme@bulkunsubscribe.com` with subject `delete me` and if you have an email registered from the recipient we will automatically delete the info within 30 days.
